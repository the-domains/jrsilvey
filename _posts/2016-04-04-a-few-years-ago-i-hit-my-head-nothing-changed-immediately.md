A few years ago, I hit my head. Nothing changed immediately. Then suddenly, everything changed. 

Something happened after a I sustained a severe concussion (and possible hematoma.. the doctors were uncertain and gave me three MRIs to make sure) to affect the neurochemistry of my brain. It started slowly but grew until it fundamentally altered the way I experience the world. 

I left a Bachelors Information Technology program and went to .. the Art Institute. I could draw. I started seeing patterns all around me, in images, and language, and events. I could figure things out, really complicated things. And I could remember. 

What would happen if you woke up one day and... just couldn't forget? What if you remembered every face you saw, every conversation you overheard, every item on every shelf in every supermarket you stepped foot in?

It happened to me. It was the most difficult period in my life. Three months blended together until I finally taught myself how to forget again. 

It was torture. Blissful, euphoric, manic, knowing torture. I understood everything, and felt everything, and experienced _every __single thing_ there was to experience. I felt alive and awake and aware and... powerless. Impotent. 

No amount of understanding could provide an explanation. I was too smart for normal people and too crazy for smart people. Remembering everything made me incapable of differentiating events happening now from events that happened yesterday. Or last week. Or last month. 

_(Let me tell you something.. people hate being told exactly what they said or did. They especially don't like it when you point out that what they said or did is different from what they are saying now.)_

I was like one of those Shamwow Super-Absorbant Towels.. only instead of water, I absorbed information. Listening to the radio was difficult because I knew all the lyrics to all the songs and felt compelled to sing along just because I knew them. My reading comprehension improved dramatically; the rate at which I was scrolling through words and data online made people think I was manic, yet I just needed to glimpse at something to record it to memory. 

It has taken months of research to understand why I started "hearing" numbers, "feeling" mathematical sequences, and \*understanding\* fundamental truths about the Universe. 

I am completely aware (both then and now) that I was making very outrageous claims; Finding patterns in a 4,000 year old Greek Disc was one, predicting cyber-attacks from China were another. Being aware of Quantum Entanglement at a Relativistic scale has affected my life at a fundamental level. "The Brain is a Hologram." "No, The Universe is a Hologram." "No, They are both a Hologram!"

But my Magnum Opus.. The Theory of Everything. (_Despite what everyone thought at the time, I wasn't saying I knew everything, I just had a Theory of Everything._)

Perhaps some perspective should be inserted here. At the end of December 2014, I was a bartender with an AA from Broward College and never took math above pre-calculus. By my 35th birthday on March 12, 2015, I had developed a working Theory of Everything (working for me.. I still don't know how to organize it), found patterns in the untranslated Phaistos Disc (If it actually forms words, the Disc is the most complex man-made artifact next to the Shuttle Program) and by connecting the symbols on the disc find geometric shapes centuries before Euclid created Geometry, maps of star constellations, and a mathematical pattern which I could not complete but may support the Disc as also containing a Sothic Calendar. 

There are names for these things. Traumatic Brain Injury. Synesthesia. Acquired Savant Syndrome. Neuroscience has only recently delved into synesthesia, a neurological syndrome which rewires the senses and causes individuals to "see" sounds, "hear" colors,  and "taste" smells.  In very rare cases, injuries to the brain can enhance memory, perception, and cognition and cause previously "neurotypical" (normal) people like [Derek Amato][0] to suddenly know how to play the piano, or Jason Padgett to start drawing fractals and doing complex mathematics, and do things they previously did not know how to do.

There are somewhere between 30 and 50 people who have "acquired" Savant Syndrome. Of these, only two that I am aware of have "acquired" Synesthesia. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cad9ace1-e5fa-4fa5-8c8f-64b599c4ba82.jpg)

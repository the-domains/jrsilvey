A few years ago, I hit my head. Nothing changed immediately. Then suddenly, everything was different. 

Something happened to change the neurochemistry of my brain. It started slowly. I became artistic, without knowing why. I could figure things out, really complicated things. And I could remember. 

What would happen if you woke up one day and... just couldn't forget? What if you remembered every face you saw, every conversation you overheard, every item on every shelf in every supermarket you stepped foot in?

It happened to me. It was the most difficult period in my life. Three months blended together until I finally taught myself how to forget once more. 

It was torture. Blissful, euphoric, manic, knowing torture. I understood everything, and felt everything, and experienced _every__single thing_ there was to experience. I felt alive and awake and... powerless. Impotent. 

No amount of understanding could provide an explanation. I was to smart for normal people, and to crazy for smart people. Remembering everything made me incapable of differentiating events happening now from events that happened yesterday. Or last week. Or last month. 

It has taken months more to understand why I started "hearing" numbers, "feeling" mathematical sequences, and \*understanding\* fundamental truths about the Universe. 

There are names for these things. Traumatic Brain Injury. Synesthesia. Acquired Savant Syndrome. Neuroscience has only recently delved into synesthesia, a neurological syndrome which rewires the senses and causes individuals to "see" sounds, "hear" colors,  and "taste" smells.  In very rare cases, injuries to the brain can enhance memory, perception, and cognition and cause previously "neurotypical" (normal) people like [Derek Amato][0] to suddenly know how to play the piano, or Jason Padgett to start drawing fractals and doing complex mathematics, and do things they previously did not know how to do.

There are somewhere between 30 and 50 people who have "acquired" Savant Syndrome. Of these, only two that I am aware of have "acquired" Synesthesia. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cad9ace1-e5fa-4fa5-8c8f-64b599c4ba82.jpg)
